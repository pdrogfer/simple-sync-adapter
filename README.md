# simple-sync-adapter
A simple app to show the basic implementation of a Sync Adapter in Android
 
### Description
This is a sample Android Studio project to get started with sync adapters. It uses [loopj](http://loopj.com/android-async-http/) to make the http requests.
Apart from that, and like the other examples of my **simple** series, there is nothing else in the code to distract you.

### Usage
Just have a look at the code, or better still, clone it to a local repository in your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/pdrogfer/simple-sync-adapter.git simple-sync-adapter
```
and open it in Android Studio. Feel free to create pull requests to improve the implementation or documentation. Give me a 
star if you find it useful!
